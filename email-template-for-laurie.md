Subject: Domain Setup Instructions for pbguidecr.com

Hi Laurie,

I've completed the initial setup for your domain on our end, and now we need to configure your Google Workspace settings to point the domain to your new website. 

First Step - Adding me as an admin:
To make this process easier and more secure, you can add me as an admin to your Google Workspace. Here's how:
1. Go to admin.google.com
2. Navigate to "Users"
3. Click "Add New User"
4. Create an account for me (you can use jp@pbguidecr.com)
5. After creating the account, assign me admin privileges
6. Send me the login credentials securely

Once you've done this, I can handle the technical DNS configuration for you, ensuring everything is set up correctly. If you prefer to do it yourself, I've attached detailed instructions that will walk you through the process.

Key Points:
1. You'll need to access your Google Workspace Admin Console
2. You'll be adding two important DNS records (an A record and a CNAME record)
3. This won't affect your email service, but will connect your domain to the website

The most important records you'll need to add are:

A Record:
- Host/Name: @
- Value: 76.76.21.21
- TTL: 3600

CNAME Record:
- Host/Name: www
- Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
- TTL: 3600

Please follow the "Part 2: Site Owner Tasks" section in the attached instructions. Take your time with this - there's no rush, and it's important to get it right.

Important Notes:
- Don't delete any existing records
- After making the changes, it can take up to 48 hours for them to fully take effect
- Your email service will continue working normally throughout this process

If you run into any questions or need clarification:
1. Read through the "Common Issues and Troubleshooting" section in the instructions
2. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need help
3. Take screenshots if you're unsure about anything

Would you like me to walk you through this over a call? Just let me know what works best for you.

Best regards,
JP
