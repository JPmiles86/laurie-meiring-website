# Critical Security Fix - Authentication Guards for Admin Routes

## Issue
**CRITICAL VULNERABILITY**: All admin routes (`/admin`, `/admin/testimonials`, `/admin/clubs`) are publicly accessible without authentication. Anyone can access and modify data.

## Files to Fix
1. `/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`
2. `/src/pages/TestimonialsAdmin.jsx`
3. `/src/pages/ClubsAdmin.jsx`
4. `/api/[...path].js` - Add authentication checks to API endpoints

## Current State
- AdminPage.jsx has authentication check
- Other admin pages (Dashboard, Testimonials, Clubs) have NO authentication
- API endpoints have NO authentication verification

## Fix Required
Add authentication guards to:
1. All admin React components
2. All API endpoints for testimonials and clubs

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Auth Guard to AdminDashboard
- Check sessionStorage for 'blogAdminAuth'
- If not authenticated, redirect to /admin (login page)

### Step 2: Add Auth Guard to TestimonialsAdmin
- Same authentication check as above
- Redirect unauthorized users

### Step 3: Add Auth Guard to ClubsAdmin
- Same authentication check as above
- Redirect unauthorized users

### Step 4: Protect API Endpoints
- Add authentication verification to /api/testimonials/*
- Add authentication verification to /api/clubs/*
- Return 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests

## Testing Required After Fix
1. Try accessing /admin/dashboard without logging in (should redirect)
2. Try accessing /admin/testimonials without logging in (should redirect)
3. Try accessing /admin/clubs without logging in (should redirect)
4. Try API calls without authentication (should return 401)
5. Verify all routes work AFTER logging in

## Priority: CRITICAL - Must fix before production
