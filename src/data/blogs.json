      "title": "From Hospitality to Digital Nomad to Pickleball Addict in Costa Rica: My Journey to Pura Vida Part 1",
      "content": "For over 20 years, I worked in the hospitality industry, wearing every hat: waiter, chef, restaurant manager, hotel manager. I loved it… until I didn't. COVID made it painfully clear how little hotel owners and corporate leadership valued us, and that pushed me toward something new.\n\nFeeling unappreciated post-pandemic, I took a bold leap - cutting my salary in half and giving up all benefits - to go fully remote. I quickly made up the difference in salary with new opportunities, and spent a year in the Canary Islands, Spain and Sardinia, Italy where I learned to play Padel. Digital Marketing has given me so much freedom. It's still my full-time hustle and I love it. It's also what brought me to Costa Rica - chasing adventure, sunshine and a fresh start.\n\n![Digital nomad lifestyle in Costa Rica](/blog-1-img1.jpeg)\n\nA few months into my time in Costa Rica, I met some people opening a Pickleball club. They needed help with digital marketing and social media, so I jumped in. One day, during a promotional shoot, I ended up as a model, paddle in hand, for my very first game of Pickleball. As a former tennis player, I picked it up fast. After a few rec games, I knew I was hooked - though mastering the kitchen game was a different story.\n\nI was already hooked on Pickleball—but my first tournament changed everything. None of the top players asked me to partner with them, which stung. But then I got lucky. I teamed up with Tara for Mixed Doubles, she was also new to the game but full of fight. We started off nervously, losing our first game to a couple we would have smoked in a rec game.\n\n![Tournament play with partner](/blog-1-Img2.jpeg)\n\nSomehow, we pulled it together—going on an unbeaten run through five matches, including a tough quarterfinal and semifinal. We didn't win with superior technical skills but with sheer grit and determination. Reaching the final felt incredible, especially considering how new we both were to the sport. We fought hard but ultimately fell to a stronger team.\n\nThe next tournament was a smaller local one and myself and my Men's Double's partner won, while Tara and I this time took a step further to take home gold, my first double Gold. At the next tournament, we entered a much tougher city competition in Heredia, near San José, and got crushed. The level of play was way higher, and my weaknesses got exposed fast. This would turn out to be the most defining weekend in my Pickleball career, I came home bummed out but fiercely determined to improve … I kept asking myself over and over, how do I get as good as those guys.\n\n![Tournament medals](/blog-1-img3.jpeg)\n\nThis started a journey of getting 1-on-1 lessons with my Coach Manu and setting up drilling sessions multiple times a week, I started reading up all the materials I could find on how to get better and started taping all my sessions so I could have video feedback. Pickleball became my life and there was space for little else outside of working hours.\n\nThat weekend in Heredia was a wake-up call. I wasn't just playing for fun anymore - I wanted to get better. What happened next? A showdown with my mentor in a tournament final, catching the coaching bug, and diving even deeper into the Pickleball obsession. More on that in Part 2",

      "title": "From Underdog to Champion: My First Cash Prize Tournament in Ojochal (Part 2 of My Pickleball Journey)",
      "content": "After my tough reality check in Heredia, I was eager for redemption. This time, I travelled to Ojochal for a 14-team Mixed Doubles tournament - my first with prize money on the line. With my usual partner Tara unavailable, I teamed up with Meli, a naturally gifted athlete whose calm and positive energy matched mine on the court.\n\nWe had never played together before, but I knew we had good chemistry from the first few rallies. The question was - could we perform under pressure?\n\n## Day 1: Battling Through the Pool Stage\n\nThere were no easy games. We held our own, winning all the matches we should have - except for one heartbreaker. We faced a high-DUPR team, dominated early, and built a 13-4 lead… only to let it slip, eventually losing 17-15 in a thriller.\n\nThat loss stung, but we regrouped. Our only other defeat came against my coach Manu and my Pickleball bestie, Pi—two players I deeply respect. Still, we finished the day in the top four, keeping our playoff hopes alive. The challenge? We needed to win two out of three matches on Day 2 to qualify for the knockout rounds.\n\n![Day 1 tournament play](/blog2pic1.jpeg)\n\n## Day 2: Playoff Push & A Shift in Mindset\n\nThe next morning, we took a tough loss in our first match. Suddenly, the pressure was on. But we fought back, grinding out the two wins we needed to squeak into the semi-finals - my real goal for the weekend.\n\nAt this point, something shifted. Unlike my past tournaments where nerves kicked in, I felt free. The pressure was off - I had already exceeded my expectations. And as soon as I let go of the result and just focused on playing my game, everything clicked.\n\n![Day 2 tournament play](/blog2pic2.jpeg)\n\n## Semi-Finals: The Rematch & a Breakthrough Win\n\nOur semi-final matchup was a copy-paste of the round-robin loss. Once again, we jumped out to a big lead, only to let it slip as our opponents clawed back.\n\nBut this time, we held our nerve. At 14-14, we pulled off two incredible rallies - both of which easily could have gone either way. 16-14. We had done it! We were in the finals, guaranteed prize money, and I was beyond thrilled.\n\nAs if scripted, the other semi-final saw Manu and Pi claim victory, setting up a dream all-Jaco final in Ojochal.\n\n![Semi-finals match](/blog2pic3.jpeg)\n\n## The Championship Match: A Mental Battle\n\nManu and Pi started strong, picking up a handy lead. Once they hit double digits, something clicked for Meli and me.\n\nWe found the kitchen faster.\nWe neutralized Manu's aggressive play.\nWe stayed patient.\n\nOne of the biggest moments came when Manu and I got into a brutal dink battle. Manu barely kept a net tape shot alive, I hit the best dink of my life and when Manu attempted an ATP, it sailed long - suddenly, we had championship point.\n\nI stepped up to serve and ripped a beauty. Pi did well to get a paddle on it, but the return clipped the net and fell short. Game over. We were champions.\n\n## Lessons from Ojochal\n\nThis tournament was more than just a win - it was a huge mental breakthrough for me.\n\n### Playing Loose vs. Playing Tense\n- The moment I stopped obsessing over results, my game flowed better.\n- No expectations = better decision-making and execution.\n\n### Winning with a New Partner\n- Chemistry matters, but strategic adjustments matter more.\n- Meli and I played smart, stuck to our strengths, and kept believing.\n\n### Beating My Coach! (Well, Kind Of...)\n- Manu is still a far superior player, but I saw firsthand how strategy and execution can level the playing field.\n\nThis tournament was proof that I was evolving—not just as a player, but in my mindset and approach to competition.",
