      "content": "Pickleball has a unique way of bringing people together, whether it's through fierce competition or the simple joy of playing a sport. But sometimes, it brings people together in unexpected ways, this is the story of how one tournament led to a partnership that turned into something much more.\n\n## The Beginning: A New Coach and a New Partner\n\nShauna was my second-ever Ojochal student when I became a Pickleball coach. From the moment I met her, I could tell she was something special. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her energy was unmatched. But what really stood out was her competitive streak, something I completely related to. Even the simplest drills saw her giving 110%, and that made her stand out. It was impossible not to like her.\n\nLater, when I reviewed the footage of our lessons, I caught Shauna making faces at my camera in the background. I couldn't help but laugh - she was as goofy as she was driven, and I found myself enjoying every minute.\n\n![Shauna and Laurie](/blog5/ShaunaLaurie1.jpeg)\n\n## A Special Tournament Invite\n\nWhen Roger, the owner of Jungle Pickleball, invited me to play in a Memorial Tournament with 12 other teams, I needed to pick a local partner. Shauna was the first person who came to mind. By this point, we had been texting regularly, and the excitement to team up was palpable. \n\n## A Tournament Full of Vibes\n\nThe tournament itself was an absolute vibe. So many teams, so much energy, and a spirit of camaraderie that was contagious. Sure, there were a few lower DUPR teams, but that didn't take away from the fun. Shauna and I hit the ground running, and when we faced our first real challenge, we were both locked in and ready to fight.\n\nWe found ourselves facing Bel (my opponent from the gripping semi-final win in my first tournament at Jungle Pickleball) and her partner, Claud, a fellow Southern African from Zimbabwe. Claud, despite being a senior player, had the power of a tennis player. He hit the ball like a cannon and had a tricky lob along with a solid kitchen game. Bel, as always, was relentless, chasing everything down and refusing to give an inch. The match was tough, but we managed to pull through with a win, it was close, though.\n\n## Unbeaten and Calm Under Pressure\n\nAs the Round Robin phase continued, Shauna and I remained unbeaten, and what struck me the most was how effortless everything felt. We were calm, encouraging, and never let the pressure get to us. It was one of those rare moments where everything just clicks. We were a team, and it felt like we'd been playing together for years.\n\nAs #1 seeds, we had an easier path to the semi-finals, and even though we had a slow start, we found our rhythm and secured our spot in the final.\n\n## The Final: A Nerve-Wracking Finish\n\nAfter a long wait and a tense second semi-final, it was finally time for the final. Shauna and I came out strong, taking an 8-4 lead in a game to 15. But just when we thought we had the game in the bag, a few unforced errors crept in. Bel and Claud, now with a surge of energy, clawed their way back to 11-13. \n\nThe nerves were high, but I remained calm. I walked over to Shauna and reminded her of how incredible she had played all day. I told her how great of a team we made, and I could sense her relax. That was all it took - two quick points later and we were champions.\n\nFull credit to Bel and Claud, they made us work for every point and never gave up. It was a match that could've easily gone the other way.\n\n![Shauna and Laurie with medals](/blog5/ShaunaLaurie2.jpeg)\n\n## More Than a Victory: A New Chapter\n\nAs the tournament ended and we celebrated our victory, something unexpected happened - Shauna and I found that the ease we felt on the court translated off it as well. What started as a competitive partnership soon blossomed into something more. The way we supported each other during tough moments, the way we communicated and worked as a team, it all created a bond that was undeniable.\n\nThe connection between Shauna and I was no longer just about Pickleball - it was about something deeper, something that had started to blossom in the background of our matches. The tournament didn't just bring us a trophy; it brought us closer together in ways we hadn't expected.\n\n## From Partners on the Court to Partners in Life\n\nSometimes, Pickleball isn't just about the game. It's about the people you meet, the friendships you form, and the unexpected connections that happen along the way. For Shauna and me, this tournament marked the beginning of something special. What started as a competitive partnership soon turned into something more - something that felt right both on and off the court.\n\nAnd that, for me, is the real victory.",

      "title": "Winning with Pi: From Rivals to Champions",
      "content": "The very first time I played in Open Play, back when Pura Pickleball was still under construction and the owner, Rick, let us all play for free, I remember being amazed by the ferocious talent of young Pi. A tiny 11-year-old dynamite package, she hit the ball like a cannon and was not out of place playing with adults.\n\n## A Growing Rivalry\n\nOnce tournaments started, my first mixed partner, Tara, and I regularly faced off against Pi and her father, Yoav. The intensity of these matches increased with every tournament. In one, we beat them in a close game during the Round Robin before meeting them again in the final, where we managed to overcome them for Tara and my first tournament win.\n\n![All four of us after a tournament](/blog4/AllfourofUs3.jpg)\n\nIn the next tournament at the Muni, Pi rose to the occasion and buried Tara and me in the Round Robin. Somehow, we made it through the playoffs while they didn't. As documented in the Ojochal Tourney Blog, Pi and my coach, Manu, dominated us in the Round Robin of that tournament. They later met us in a dream final, where they held a strong lead before Meli and I mounted an insane comeback to clinch the championship.\n\n## Pi's Determination to Win\n\nWith every shortcoming, Pi's resolve to win a big tournament only grew stronger. She continued training with Coach Manu, competing more, and building her mental game to better handle big moments.\n\nIt was with this context that Pi and I finally agreed to join forces and play a tournament at our home club, Pura Pickleball in Jaco.\n\n## A Rocky Start\n\nWe started against a team that had never played together—JP, \"The Banger,\" who was fast improving his slow game, and his partner, Cata, who was still relatively new to the sport. Perhaps underestimating them, and still figuring out our own team chemistry, Pi and I suffered a shock loss.\n\nWe knew that because of the tournament format, everyone had a chance in the playoffs. Our next match was against the tournament favourites, a last-minute scratch team featuring Sherri and Corey. This time, we woke up—taking an early lead, letting it slip, regaining momentum—only to lose in a heartbreaking 14-16 battle. We knew we had work to do to turn the day around.\n\n## Gaining Momentum\n\nWhat followed was two dominant wins where we dropped only two points. In the first round of Single Elimination, we met JP and Cata again. This time, we had rhythm and momentum, securing a victory that set up a final rematch with Sherri and Corey.\n\n![Pi and Laurie with medals](/blog4/PiandLaurieMedals3.jpg)\n\n## A Championship Comeback\n\nWe started the final terribly, quickly falling behind 0-6 in the one-game final to 15. Yet, I recall feeling so calm, and Pi's energy mirrored mine—it felt like just a matter of time.\n\nThen, just like that, a switch flipped. We found our game, clawed back, and suddenly, we were changing sides with an 8-6 lead, moving to our favoured side. Before we knew it, we had match point, and fittingly, Pi sealed the win at 15-7. We were the champions!\n\n## A Special Victory\n\nPi more than held her own—at times, it felt like she carried me. We did an amazing job lifting each other up after mistakes, making each other laugh when we felt down, and most of all, we had the added bonus of our Coach Manu cheering us on. His presence was invaluable in key moments, and we both wanted so badly to make him proud.\n\n![Pi, Manu, and Laurie](/blog4/PiManuLaurie3.jpg)\n\nThis victory was especially sweet because it represented a full circle moment in my pickleball journey. From facing Pi as a fierce opponent to winning as partners, our combined journey showcases what makes pickleball so special - the community, growth, and pure joy of the game.",

      "title": "From Player to Coach: My Accelerated Journey into Pickleball Coaching",
      "content": "I was deep into my Pickleball journey - competing, training, and just starting my Pickleball Coaching Certification - when an unexpected opportunity presented itself.\n\nDuring a conversation with a friend from Jungle Pickleball in Ojochal, she casually mentioned that the club was looking for a coach. That got my attention.\n\nI reached out to the club owner, and after multiple rounds of discussions, we decided to give it a try. My credibility in Ojochal was already sky-high after my recent tournament win, so the timing couldn't have been better.\n\n## Preparing for My First Coaching Sessions\n\nI was determined to hit the ground running. First, I pushed myself to the limit, fast-tracking my Pickleball Coaching Certification to ensure I was fully qualified for my first official lessons. It meant long nights studying, relentless practice sessions, and cramming in every bit of coaching knowledge I could absorb - I would not show up unprepared.\n\n![PCI Certification](/blog3/CertificatePCI.jpg)\n\nI also knew I needed real coaching experience before stepping onto the court with paying students. So, I offered free lessons to my friends and their kids. Their feedback was incredibly helpful, and those early sessions built my confidence for what was coming next.\n\n## A Fully Booked Schedule - Before I Even Started\n\nWhen my first official coaching weekend arrived, I had a packed two-day schedule—six lessons per day!\n\nTo make sure I delivered real value, I set up a camera and mic'd myself up during my sessions. This allowed me to send video feedback to my students, something that had been game-changing in my own Pickleball development. Reviewing what my coach told me - and seeing how I reacted, especially when things got technical, really helped me improve. I wanted to offer the same experience to my students.\n\n![Coaching Session](/blog3/LaurieCoachingHero1.jpg)\n\n## The Response? Overwhelming!\n\nThe sessions went incredibly well, and the feedback was amazing. The biggest sign of success? When the next two-day coaching block was announced, all the slots were filled within hours.\n\nIt was official - I had become a Pickleball Coach.\n\n## Lessons Learned from My First Coaching Experience\n\nTeaching is Different from Playing – Just because you can play doesn't mean you can coach. I had to break down skills in ways that made sense to beginners.\n\nPreparation is Everything – Having a plan for each session made the lessons flow smoothly.\n\nVideo is a Powerful Tool – My students loved having video feedback, and it helped them absorb what we worked on.\n\nConfidence Comes with Experience – I was nervous at first, but each session made me more comfortable.\n\n## What's Next? Growing as a Coach\n\nMy coaching journey has only just begun, but the response so far has been incredible. Now, I'm focused on:\n\n✓ Refining my coaching techniques\n\n✓ Expanding my client base\n\n✓ Helping more players level up their game\n\nLooking back, it's crazy to think that a casual conversation led me here. But that's how Pickleball works - it pulls you in, surprises you, and opens doors you never expected.",

      "title": "From Underdog to Champion: My First Cash Prize Tournament in Ojochal (Part 2 of My Pickleball Journey)",
      "content": "After my tough reality check in Heredia, I was eager for redemption. This time, I travelled to Ojochal for a 14-team Mixed Doubles tournament - my first with prize money on the line. With my usual partner Tara unavailable, I teamed up with Meli, a naturally gifted athlete whose calm and positive energy matched mine on the court.\n\nWe had never played together before, but I knew we had good chemistry from the first few rallies. The question was - could we perform under pressure?\n\n## Day 1: Battling Through the Pool Stage\n\nThere were no easy games. We held our own, winning all the matches we should have - except for one heartbreaker. We faced a high-DUPR team, dominated early, and built a 13-4 lead… only to let it slip, eventually losing 17-15 in a thriller.\n\nThat loss stung, but we regrouped. Our only other defeat came against my coach Manu and my Pickleball bestie, Pi—two players I deeply respect. Still, we finished the day in the top four, keeping our playoff hopes alive. The challenge? We needed to win two out of three matches on Day 2 to qualify for the knockout rounds.\n\n![Day 1 tournament play](/blog2pic1.jpeg)\n\n## Day 2: Playoff Push & A Shift in Mindset\n\nThe next morning, we took a tough loss in our first match. Suddenly, the pressure was on. But we fought back, grinding out the two wins we needed to squeak into the semi-finals - my real goal for the weekend.\n\nAt this point, something shifted. Unlike my past tournaments where nerves kicked in, I felt free. The pressure was off - I had already exceeded my expectations. And as soon as I let go of the result and just focused on playing my game, everything clicked.\n\n![Day 2 tournament play](/blog2/blog2pic2.jpg)\n\n## Semi-Finals: The Rematch & a Breakthrough Win\n\nOur semi-final matchup was a copy-paste of the round-robin loss. Once again, we jumped out to a big lead, only to let it slip as our opponents clawed back.\n\nBut this time, we held our nerve. At 14-14, we pulled off two incredible rallies - both of which easily could have gone either way. 16-14. We had done it! We were in the finals, guaranteed prize money, and I was beyond thrilled.\n\nAs if scripted, the other semi-final saw Manu and Pi claim victory, setting up a dream all-Jaco final in Ojochal.\n\n![Semi-finals match](/blog2/blog2pic3.jpg)\n\n## The Championship Match: A Mental Battle\n\nManu and Pi started strong, picking up a handy lead. Once they hit double digits, something clicked for Meli and me.\n\nWe found the kitchen faster.\nWe neutralized Manu's aggressive play.\nWe stayed patient.\n\nOne of the biggest moments came when Manu and I got into a brutal dink battle. Manu barely kept a net tape shot alive, I hit the best dink of my life and when Manu attempted an ATP, it sailed long - suddenly, we had championship point.\n\nI stepped up to serve and ripped a beauty. Pi did well to get a paddle on it, but the return clipped the net and fell short. Game over. We were champions.\n\n## Lessons from Ojochal\n\nThis tournament was more than just a win - it was a huge mental breakthrough for me.\n\n### Playing Loose vs. Playing Tense\n- The moment I stopped obsessing over results, my game flowed better.\n- No expectations = better decision-making and execution.\n\n### Winning with a New Partner\n- Chemistry matters, but strategic adjustments matter more.\n- Meli and I played smart, stuck to our strengths, and kept believing.\n\n### Beating My Coach! (Well, Kind Of...)\n- Manu is still a far superior player, but I saw firsthand how strategy and execution can level the playing field.\n\nThis tournament was proof that I was evolving—not just as a player, but in my mindset and approach to competition.",

      "title": "From Hospitality to Digital Nomad to Pickleball Addict in Costa Rica: My Journey to Pura Vida Part 1",
      "content": "For over 20 years, I worked in the hospitality industry, wearing every hat: waiter, chef, restaurant manager, hotel manager. I loved it… until I didn't. COVID made it painfully clear how little hotel owners and corporate leadership valued us, and that pushed me toward something new.\n\nFeeling unappreciated post-pandemic, I took a bold leap—cutting my salary in half and giving up all benefits—to go fully remote. I quickly made up the difference in salary with new opportunities and spent a year in the Canary Islands, Spain, and Sardinia, Italy, where I learned to play Padel. Digital Marketing has given me so much freedom. It's still my full-time hustle and I love it. It's also what brought me to Costa Rica—chasing adventure, sunshine, and a fresh start.\n\n![Digital nomad lifestyle in Costa Rica](/blog1/img1.jpg)\n\n## Discovering Pickleball in Costa Rica\n\nA few months into my time in Costa Rica, I met some people opening a Pickleball club. They needed help with digital marketing and social media, so I jumped in. One day, during a promotional shoot, I ended up as a model, paddle in hand, for my very first game of Pickleball. As a former tennis player, I picked it up fast. After a few rec games, I knew I was hooked—though mastering the kitchen game was a different story.\n\n## My First Tournament Experience\n\nI was already hooked on Pickleball—but my first tournament changed everything. None of the top players asked me to partner with them, which stung. But then I got lucky. I teamed up with Tara for Mixed Doubles—she was also new to the game but full of fight. We started off nervously, losing our first game to a couple we would have smoked in a rec game.\n\n## The Turning Point\n\nSomehow, we pulled it together—going on an unbeaten run through five matches, including a tough quarterfinal and semifinal. We didn't win with superior technical skills but with sheer grit and determination. Reaching the final felt incredible, especially considering how new we both were to the sport. We fought hard but ultimately fell to a stronger team.\n\n![Tournament play with partner](/blog1/Img2.jpg)\n\n## First Gold and Harsh Lessons in Heredia\n\nThe next tournament was a smaller local one. My Men's Doubles partner and I won, while Tara and I took it a step further to claim gold—my first double gold. At the next tournament, we entered a much tougher city competition in Heredia, near San José, and got crushed. The level of play was way higher, and my weaknesses got exposed fast. This would turn out to be the most defining weekend in my Pickleball career. I came home bummed out but fiercely determined to improve… I kept asking myself over and over, how do I get as good as those guys?\n\n![Tournament reflection](/blog1/blog-1-img3.jpeg)\n\n## The Obsession to Improve\n\nThis started a journey of getting 1-on-1 lessons with my Coach Manu and setting up drilling sessions multiple times a week. I started reading up on all the materials I could find about improving my game and began recording all my sessions for video feedback. Pickleball became my life, and there was space for little else outside of working hours.\n\n## A Wake-Up Call\n\nThat weekend in Heredia was a wake-up call. I wasn't just playing for fun anymore—I wanted to get better. What happened next? A showdown with my mentor in a tournament final, catching the coaching bug, and diving even deeper into the Pickleball obsession. More on that in Part 2.",
