# **From Hospitality to Digital Nomad to Pickleball Addict in Costa Rica: My Journey to Pura Vida Part 1**

## **From Hospitality to Digital Marketing**

For over 20 years, I worked in the hospitality industry, wearing every hat: waiter, chef, restaurant manager, hotel manager. I loved it… until I didn't. COVID made it painfully clear how little hotel owners and corporate leadership valued us, and that pushed me toward something new.

Feeling unappreciated post-pandemic, I took a bold leap—cutting my salary in half and giving up all benefits—to go fully remote. I quickly made up the difference in salary with new opportunities and spent a year in the Canary Islands, Spain, and Sardinia, Italy, where I learned to play Padel. Digital Marketing has given me so much freedom. It's still my full-time hustle and I love it. It's also what brought me to Costa Rica—chasing adventure, sunshine, and a fresh start.

## **Discovering Pickleball in Costa Rica**

A few months into my time in Costa Rica, I met some people opening a Pickleball club. They needed help with digital marketing and social media, so I jumped in. One day, during a promotional shoot, I ended up as a model, paddle in hand, for my very first game of Pickleball. As a former tennis player, I picked it up fast. After a few rec games, I knew I was hooked—though mastering the kitchen game was a different story.

## **My First Tournament Experience**

I was already hooked on Pickleball—but my first tournament changed everything. None of the top players asked me to partner with them, which stung. But then I got lucky. I teamed up with Tara for Mixed Doubles—she was also new to the game but full of fight. We started off nervously, losing our first game to a couple we would have smoked in a rec game.

## **The Turning Point**

Somehow, we pulled it together—going on an unbeaten run through five matches, including a tough quarterfinal and semifinal. We didn't win with superior technical skills but with sheer grit and determination. Reaching the final felt incredible, especially considering how new we both were to the sport. We fought hard but ultimately fell to a stronger team.

## **First Gold and Harsh Lessons in Heredia**

The next tournament was a smaller local one. My Men's Doubles partner and I won, while Tara and I took it a step further to claim gold—my first double gold. At the next tournament, we entered a much tougher city competition in Heredia, near San José, and got crushed. The level of play was way higher, and my weaknesses got exposed fast. This would turn out to be the most defining weekend in my Pickleball career. I came home bummed out but fiercely determined to improve… I kept asking myself over and over, how do I get as good as those guys?

## **The Obsession to Improve**

This started a journey of getting 1-on-1 lessons with my Coach Manu and setting up drilling sessions multiple times a week. I started reading up on all the materials I could find about improving my game and began recording all my sessions for video feedback. Pickleball became my life, and there was space for little else outside of working hours.

## **A Wake-Up Call**

That weekend in Heredia was a wake-up call. I wasn't just playing for fun anymore—I wanted to get better. What happened next? A showdown with my mentor in a tournament final, catching the coaching bug, and diving even deeper into the Pickleball obsession. More on that in Part 2\.
