## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Management Workflow:
1. User clicks "Add Images" button
2. MediaUploader modal opens with upload interface
3. User uploads image to Google Cloud Storage
4. Image added to `uploadedImages` array with metadata
5. Form data synced with image URLs
6. Visual preview shows in grid layout
7. Users can remove or reorder images as needed

### State Synchronization:
- `uploadedImages` array stores image objects with url, alt, filename
- `formData.images` array stores just the URLs for API submission
- Both arrays stay synchronized through dedicated handlers

### Error Prevention:
- Unsaved changes warning prevents accidental data loss
- Body scroll cleanup prevents UI glitches
- Proper modal layering prevents interaction issues

## Testing Results

### ✅ Manual Testing Completed:
1. **Modal Scrolling**: Confirmed background scroll disabled when modal open
2. **Form Spacing**: Verified all field pairs have proper gaps
3. **Unsaved Changes**: Tested warning appears and can be dismissed
4. **Image Upload**: Confirmed MediaUploader integration works
5. **Image Management**: Tested remove and reorder functionality
6. **Form Submission**: Verified images save correctly to club data

### ✅ Edge Cases Handled:
- Component unmount restores body scroll
- Empty image state shows "Add Images" button
- Existing clubs populate image preview correctly
- Form reset clears all unsaved changes flags
- Successful save dismisses unsaved changes warning

## Issues Encountered
- **None** - All implementations completed successfully without blockers

## Migration Status
- **Not Required**: Existing club images will continue to work through URL loading
- **Future Enhancement**: Existing local image URLs can be migrated to GCS over time
- **Backward Compatible**: System supports both local URLs and GCS URLs seamlessly

## Conclusion
All 4 critical UI issues have been successfully resolved. The Clubs Management interface now provides:
- Professional image management with GCS integration
- Smooth modal interactions without background scroll issues
- Proper form field spacing for better UX
- Data protection through unsaved changes warnings

The interface is now production-ready with significantly improved user experience.
