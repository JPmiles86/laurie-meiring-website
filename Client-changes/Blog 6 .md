**From Agassi to Me: How a Legend threw Gas on my Pickleball Fire** 

When I saw Andre Agassi, my childhood tennis hero, step onto the court at age 55 to compete in a PPA Pickleball tournament alongside Anna Leigh Waters, I couldn’t help but feel a surge of something deep. Not just nostalgia. Not just admiration. Inspiration.

**A Comeback that Hit Me Right in the Feels**

Let me rewind. Back in my tennis days, I wasn’t just a casual Agassi fan, I was Agassi-obsessed. The flair, the fire, the headbands, the rebel energy. He didn’t just play tennis, he lived it on his own terms. And for a kid like me, that mattered.

**Pickleball: The New Obsession**

Fast forward a couple of decades and here I am, 46 years old, diving headfirst into Pickleball, the sport I never saw coming, but which now shapes my days, my work, and my purpose. I’m training, coaching, competing, improving. Only ten months ago, I picked up a Paddle for the first time, now, I’m all-in. Coaching. Training. Running events. Playing tournaments. Even launching a business around it. It’s funny, Pickleball started as a casual curiosity, and now it’s a central force in my life.

**The Agassi Paddle that Closed the Loop** 

Recently I switched to the Agassi JOOLA paddle, designed for players like me: ex-tennis, two-handed backhand, power-focused. It immediately clicked. Using the Agassi paddle feels like coming full circle. It’s not just a piece of gear, it’s a symbol. 

A reminder of where I started and how far I’ve come. It connects my past in tennis to my present in Pickleball in a really powerful way.

**Why Watching Agassi Compete Meant So Much** 

Seeing Agassi step onto a Pickleball court, even decades past his prime, was nothing short of inspiring. He wasn’t trying to prove anything. He was simply there to *play*. To compete. To connect with the game and the crowd and maybe even with a new generation.

It reminded me that age is just a number, and passion doesn’t have an expiry date.

He might not have been the fastest on the court. He might not have dominated. But his timing, his touch, and his sheer willingness to show up, it was everything. 

**The Real Lesson: Keep Showing Up**

Agassi’s comeback wasn’t about glory. It wasn’t about medals. It was about presence. It was about proving, to himself and maybe the rest of us, that joy, competition, and passion don’t need to fade.

That’s the energy I’m carrying into this next chapter of my Pickleball journey. Not to be the best in the world, but to give my best to the game I love.

So here’s to the comeback stories. The full-circle moments. The courage to compete, no matter your age, history, or journey.
