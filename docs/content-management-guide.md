# Instructions for Laurie: Managing Club & Event Listings

Hi Laurie,

We've set up some new systems to help manage the club and event listings on the website. Here's a guide on how to use them:

**1. Featured Clubs (Multi-Step Process):**

*   **Goal:** To gather detailed information for clubs you want to feature prominently (with photos, descriptions, amenities, your review, etc.).
*   **Step 1: Initial Contact & Interest:**
    *   When you talk to a club owner interested in being featured, direct them to the public **"Feature Your Club"** page:
        *   `https://www.pbguidecr.com/feature-your-club`
    *   This page explains the benefits and has a *short* form (Name, Club Name, Email, Phone, Location) for them to register their initial interest.
*   **Step 2: Follow Up:**
    *   You will receive an email notification from Formspree (`Club Feature Interest: [Club Name]`) when someone submits this short form.
    *   Reach out to the club contact personally.
*   **Step 3: Gather Detailed Information:**
    *   Send the club contact the **private link** to the detailed **"Club Information Form"**:
        *   `https://www.pbguidecr.com/club-information-form`
    *   *Important:* This link is *not* visible on the website navigation. You need to send it directly.
    *   This form collects all the details needed for the listing (courts, amenities, schedule, etc.) and includes a field for any "Other" amenities.
*   **Step 4: Photos:**
    *   The detailed form instructs them to email you a minimum of 3 photos separately.
*   **Step 5: Update the Website:**
    *   You will receive a second email notification from Formspree (`New Club Feature Submission: [Club Name]`) when they complete the detailed form.
    *   **Action Needed:** Please **forward this Formspree email** *and* **the separate email containing their photos** to JP. JP will then manually add the club's full details, your review (we can coordinate on this text), and their photos to the website data and deploy the update.

**2. Basic Club Listings (Simpler Process):**

*   **Goal:** To list clubs in the directory with just their essential contact information (name, city, province, one contact method). These don't require the detailed form or your review initially.
*   **Process:** For adding *new* basic clubs or updating existing ones, the easiest way is using a CSV file (like a simple spreadsheet).
*   **Action Needed:** Please fill in the details for any new basic clubs in the `basic_club_template.csv` file located in the main project folder. When you have new entries or updates, send the updated CSV file to JP. JP will manually update the website data.

**3. Event Submissions (For Featured Clubs Only):**

*   **Goal:** To allow clubs *that are already featured* on the site to submit their events for the calendar.
*   **Process:**
    *   Provide the **private link** to the **"Submit Your Event"** page only to your contacts at *featured* clubs:
        *   `https://www.pbguidecr.com/submit-event`
    *   This form asks them to select their club from a dropdown and enter all event details (name, type, dates, description, registration info, etc.).
*   **Step 2: Photos/Flyers:**
    *   The form instructs them to email you any event photos or flyers separately.
*   **Step 3: Update the Website:**
    *   You will receive an email notification from Formspree (`New Event Submission: [Event Name] at [Club Name]`) when they submit an event.
    *   **Action Needed:** Please **forward this Formspree email** *and* **any event photos/flyers** you receive to JP. JP will manually add the event to the website data and deploy the update.

**4. Partner Matching:**

*   The "Find a Partner" page (`/find-partner`) and form are built.
*   It's *not currently linked* in the main website navigation. We can add it whenever you decide you want to launch this feature.

**Important URLs Summary:**

*   **Public "Interest" Page:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/feature-your-club`
*   **Private Club Info Form:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/club-information-form`
*   **Private Event Submission Form:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/submit-event`
*   **(Future) Partner Matching:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/find-partner`
*   **Clubs Directory:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/clubs`
*   **Events Calendar:** `https://www.pbguidecr.com/events`

**Key Takeaway:** Submitting the forms *does not* automatically update the live website. For any new featured clubs, basic clubs (via CSV), or events, you need to forward the Formspree emails and any associated files (photos, CSV) to JP so JP can manually update the site's data files and deploy the changes.

Let JP know if you have any questions about this workflow!
