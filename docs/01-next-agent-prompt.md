# Instructions for Next Agent

## Current Project State
- **Phase**: Implementation
- **Progress**: 90% - Documentation is complete, sample data files created, Featured Clubs, Events Calendar, and Partner Matching Form have been implemented
- **Last Agent**: Agent-2: Claude - Implementation Engineer
- **Date**: 2025-03-26

## Your Objective
Your task is to perform testing and finalization of the Costa Rica Pickleball website implementation. All three main components (Featured Clubs, Events Calendar, and Partner Matching Form) have been implemented. You should now focus on testing these components, fixing any bugs, and improving the user experience. Additionally, you should update any documentation to reflect the completed implementation.

### Implemented Components
- Featured Clubs section with filtering and modal details
- Events Calendar with event type and date filtering
- Partner Matching Form with form validation and Formspree integration

### Formspree Integration
- The Partner Matching Form has been integrated with Formspree using ID: `https://formspree.io/f/mwplqdgo`
- Email template for the auto-response is at `/email-templates/partner-matching-template.md`
- The form has been implemented with validation and a success message

## Project Overview
The Costa Rica Pickleball website is being enhanced with three main features:

1. **Featured Clubs Section** - A section showcasing selected pickleball clubs in Costa Rica
2. **Pickleball Events Calendar** - A chronological listing of various pickleball events (tournaments, leagues, etc.)
3. **Partner Matching Form** - A form for users to find pickleball partners

## Implementation Priority
1. Featured Clubs Section (Highest Priority)
2. Pickleball Events Calendar (Medium Priority)
3. Partner Matching Form (Lower Priority)

## Key Implementation Details

### Featured Clubs Section
- Implement as a grid-based layout of club cards
- Use modal popups for detailed club information rather than separate pages
- Include map integration for club locations
- Add a simple, non-promotional CTA at the bottom directing club owners to the contact page
- Only display clubs with isFeatured=true and valid featuredUntil dates
- No pricing information should be displayed anywhere
- Ensure the design allows for showing upcoming events hosted by the club

### Pickleball Events Calendar
- Create a chronological list of events with filtering capabilities
- Support multiple event types (tournaments, leagues, clinics, etc.)
- Use modal popups for detailed event information
- Link events to clubs when applicable
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Add a simple CTA directing event organizers to the contact form
- All events will be manually added by the site administrator
- Include connections between events and clubs:
  - Show hosting club details on event pages (when applicable)
  - Show upcoming events on club detail pages (when applicable)

### Partner Matching Form
- Create a comprehensive form based on the data model
- Integrate with Formspree following the pattern in ContactPage.jsx
- Implement client-side validation
- Create success and error handling screens
- Note: Client will need to create a new Formspree form and provide the form ID

## Technical Guidelines
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Follow the style guide for consistent styling
- Use the sample data files as a starting point
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Optimize images and assets for performance
- Write clean, documented code

## Documentation to Reference
- `data-models.md` - For data structure details
- `style-guide.md` - For design guidelines
- `implementation-guide.md` - For step-by-step implementation approach
- `maintenance-guide.md` - For long-term considerations

## Starting Points
- `src/data/clubs.js` - Sample club data
- `src/data/events.js` - Sample event data
- `src/components/TournamentList.jsx` - Example component (will need to be updated to EventList)

## Deliverables
1. React components for the Featured Clubs Section
2. React components for the Pickleball Events Calendar
3. React components for the Partner Matching Form
4. Updated contact form to include "Feature My Club" option
5. Documentation of any implementation decisions or challenges

## Known Constraints
- All data is static (no database)
- Form submissions handled via Formspree
- Must maintain mobile-responsive design
- No pricing information or payment handling on the site
- All content management happens manually offline

## Additional Notes
- The site is primarily for pickleball players to find information about clubs and events
- The focus should be on providing value to players, not on promoting the business aspects
- CTAs should be simple and straightforward (not sales-oriented)
- Modal-based designs are preferred for detail views to improve user experience
- All content updates will be performed manually by the site administrator

Your implementation should balance functionality, design quality, and code maintainability while keeping the focus on providing value to pickleball players in Costa Rica.
