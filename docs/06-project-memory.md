# Project Memory: Costa Rica Pickleball Website

## Project Overview
This document serves as a living record of key decisions, implementation approaches, and progress in the Costa Rica Pickleball website project. It is maintained to ensure continuity of knowledge across different phases of development.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Implementation
- **Overall Progress**: 90%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-26 by Agent-2: Claude

## Implementation Decisions

### Website Architecture
- **Decision**: The website will be built using React, with a static data approach rather than a dynamic CMS.
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, lower maintenance, and sufficient for the project's current scope.
- **Alternatives Considered**: WordPress, Squarespace, or other CMS solutions would require more ongoing maintenance and technical knowledge.
- **Date Made**: 2023-05-20

### Data Management
- **Decision**: All data will be stored in static JSON files rather than a database.
- **Rationale**: Simplifies implementation and deployment, avoids database hosting costs.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Firebase, MongoDB, or other cloud databases would add complexity and cost.
- **Date Made**: 2023-05-22

### Form Submissions
- **Decision**: User forms (contact, partner matching) will use email-based submission via Formspree.
- **Rationale**: Eliminates need for server-side code, leverages existing solution, streamlines implementation.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Custom server endpoints, Firebase functions, or other form handling services.
- **Implementation Pattern**: Forms will follow the approach in the existing ContactPage.jsx, sending data to Formspree.
- **Note**: Client will need to create a new Formspree form for the partner matching feature and provide the form ID.
- **Date Made**: 2023-05-25

### Featured Clubs Business Model
- **Decision**: The clubs directory will only display "featured" clubs that pay for inclusion.
- **Rationale**: Creates a sustainable revenue model for website maintenance while providing value to club owners.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Free comprehensive directory (no revenue)
  - Tiered listings with premium features (more complex to implement)
  - Advertising-based model (less predictable revenue)
- **Implementation Approach**: 
  - Club listings will be marked as "featured" in the data model
  - Featured status will have an expiration date
  - Contact form will include a "Feature my club" option
  - A CTA on the Featured Clubs page will direct users to the contact form
  - No pricing information will be displayed publicly on the website
  - All business discussions and arrangements will happen offline
  - One-time fee for initially listing the club
  - Annual renewals with potential discounts
- **Pricing Structure**: To be discussed offline with club owners (not displayed on website)
- **Date Updated**: 2023-05-26

### Events Calendar Business Model
- **Decision**: Include events from various clubs and organizations across Costa Rica.
- **Rationale**: Provides a valuable central resource for pickleball players to find games and activities.
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - All approved events displayed on Events Calendar page
  - Events can be linked to their hosting club when applicable
  - Events removed after completion
  - Club representatives contact via the standard contact form to submit events
  - Events connected to clubs will be displayed on both the club's listing and the events page
- **Integration with Clubs**: Bidirectional relationship between events and clubs provides a complete view of the pickleball community.
- **Management**: All events managed manually by site administrator based on submitted information.
- **Date Updated**: 2023-05-26

### Events Calendar Scope
- **Decision**: Broaden the scope from "Tournament Calendar" to "Events Calendar"
- **Rationale**: More inclusive of various pickleball activities (leagues, clinics, social events), providing more value to users
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Separate sections for different event types (increases navigation complexity)
  - Tournament-only focus (limits utility)
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Single calendar interface with filtering by event type
  - Modal-based detail views rather than separate pages
  - Integration with featured clubs where applicable
- **Date Made**: 2023-05-25

### UI Approach for Detail Views
- **Decision**: Use modal popups for club and event details rather than separate pages
- **Rationale**: Improves user experience by reducing page loads, maintains context, and simplifies implementation
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Separate detail pages (more traditional but requires more navigation)
  - Expandable rows/cards (limited space for content)
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Responsive modals that work on both desktop and mobile
  - Modals will contain all relevant details, images, and maps
- **Date Made**: 2023-05-25
