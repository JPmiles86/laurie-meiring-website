My Pickleball Coaching Approach 

| My Coaching Approach I believe the fastest way to improve is by mastering both the slow and fast aspects of the game. That’s why every session starts at the kitchen, focusing on control, technique, and strategic shot selection. By assessing footwork, paddle mechanics, and shot consistency, I tailor each lesson to individual needs—whether it's refining the drop shot, enhancing variety, or building a more complete game. ✅ Kitchen-First Approach – Master soft game fundamentals before adding speed✅ Personalised Coaching – Identify key areas for improvement based on real-time play✅ Drop Shot Focus – Learn the most effective way to transition to the net✅ Pressure Drills – Use scoring and match scenarios to improve decision-making✅ Variety & Strategy – Develop a mix of shots to keep opponents off balance✅ Game-Based Learning – End each session with live play to apply new skills \[Schedule your Session Button\]  | Image 2 TBD  |
