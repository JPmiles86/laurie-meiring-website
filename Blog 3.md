# **From Player to Coach: My Accelerated Journey into Pickleball Coaching**

## **The Opportunity That Changed Everything**

I was deep into my Pickleball journey \- competing, training, and just starting my **Pickleball** **Coaching Certification** \- when an unexpected opportunity presented itself.

During a conversation with a friend from **Jungle Pickleball in Ojochal**, she casually mentioned that the club was looking for a coach. That got my attention.

I reached out to the club owner, and after multiple rounds of discussions, we decided to **give it a try**. My credibility in Ojochal was already **sky-high** after my recent tournament win, so the timing couldn‚Äôt have been better.

## **Preparing for My First Coaching Sessions**

I was determined to hit the ground running. First, I **pushed myself to the limit**, fast-tracking my Pickleball Coaching Certification to ensure I was fully qualified for my first official lessons. It meant **long nights studying, relentless practice sessions, and cramming in every bit of coaching knowledge I could absorb** \- I would not show up unprepared.

I also knew I needed **real coaching experience** before stepping onto the court with paying students. So, I offered **free lessons** to my friends and their kids. Their feedback was incredibly helpful, and those early sessions **built my confidence** for what was coming next.

## **A Fully Booked Schedule \- Before I Even Started**

When my first **official coaching weekend** arrived, I had a packed **two-day schedule**‚Äî**six lessons per day**\!

To make sure I delivered real value, I set up a camera and mic‚Äôd myself up during my sessions. This allowed me to send video feedback to my students, something that had been **game-changing** in my own Pickleball development. Reviewing what my coach told me \- and seeing how I reacted, especially when things got technical, really helped me improve. I wanted to offer the same experience to my students.

## **The Response? Overwhelming\!**

The sessions went **incredibly well**, and the feedback was amazing. The biggest sign of success? When the next two-day **coaching block** was announced, all the slots were filled **within hours**.

It was official \- I had become a **Pickleball Coach**.

## **Lessons Learned from My First Coaching Experience**

**Teaching is Different from Playing** ‚Äì Just because you can play doesn‚Äôt mean you can coach. I had to **break down skills** in ways that made sense to beginners.

**Preparation is Everything** ‚Äì Having a plan for each session made the lessons **flow smoothly**.

**Video is a Powerful Tool** ‚Äì My students loved having **video feedback**, and it helped them absorb what we worked on.

**Confidence Comes with Experience** ‚Äì I was **nervous at first**, but each session made me more comfortable.

## **What‚Äôs Next? Growing as a Coach**

My coaching journey has only just begun, but the response so far has been incredible. Now, I‚Äôm focused on:  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Refining my coaching techniques  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Expanding my **client base**  
 ‚úîÔ∏è Helping more players **level up their game**

Looking back, it‚Äôs crazy to think that a **casual conversation** led me here. But that‚Äôs how Pickleball works \- it pulls you in, surprises you, and opens doors you never expected.
