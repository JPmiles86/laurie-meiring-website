**Love and Pickleball: A Winning Combination**

Pickleball has a unique way of bringing people together, whether it’s through fierce competition or the simple joy of playing a sport. But sometimes, it brings people together in unexpected ways, this is the story of how one tournament led to a partnership that turned into something much more.

**The Beginning: A New Coach and a New Partner**

Shauna was my second-ever Ojochal student when I became a Pickleball coach. From the moment I met her, I could tell she was something special. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her energy was unmatched. But what really stood out was her competitive streak, something I completely related to. Even the simplest drills saw her giving 110%, and that made her stand out. It was impossible not to like her.

Later, when I reviewed the footage of our lessons, I caught Shauna making faces at my camera in the background. I couldn't help but laugh \- she was as goofy as she was driven, and I found myself enjoying every minute.

**A Special Tournament Invite**

When Roger, the owner of Jungle Pickleball, invited me to play in a Memorial Tournament with 12 other teams, I needed to pick a local partner. Shauna was the first person who came to mind. By this point, we had been texting regularly, and the excitement to team up was palpable. 

**A Tournament Full of Vibes**

The tournament itself was an absolute vibe. So many teams, so much energy, and a spirit of camaraderie that was contagious. Sure, there were a few lower DUPR teams, but that didn’t take away from the fun. Shauna and I hit the ground running, and when we faced our first real challenge, we were both locked in and ready to fight.

We found ourselves facing Bel (my opponent from the gripping semi-final win in my first tournament at Jungle Pickleball) and her partner, Claud, a fellow Southern African from Zimbabwe. Claud, despite being a senior player, had the power of a tennis player. He hit the ball like a cannon and had a tricky lob along with a solid kitchen game. Bel, as always, was relentless, chasing everything down and refusing to give an inch. The match was tough, but we managed to pull through with a win, it was close, though.

**Unbeaten and Calm Under Pressure**

As the Round Robin phase continued, Shauna and I remained unbeaten, and what struck me the most was how effortless everything felt. We were calm, encouraging, and never let the pressure get to us. It was one of those rare moments where everything just clicks. We were a team, and it felt like we'd been playing together for years.

As \#1 seeds, we had an easier path to the semi-finals, and even though we had a slow start, we found our rhythm and secured our spot in the final.

**The Final: A Nerve-Wracking Finish**

After a long wait and a tense second semi-final, it was finally time for the final. Shauna and I came out strong, taking an 8-4 lead in a game to 15\. But just when we thought we had the game in the bag, a few unforced errors crept in. Bel and Claud, now with a surge of energy, clawed their way back to 11-13. 

The nerves were high, but I remained calm. I walked over to Shauna and reminded her of how incredible she had played all day. I told her how great of a team we made, and I could sense her relax. That was all it took \- two quick points later and we were champions.

Full credit to Bel and Claud, they made us work for every point and never gave up. It was a match that could’ve easily gone the other way.

**More Than a Victory: A New Chapter**

As the tournament ended and we celebrated our victory, something unexpected happened \- Shauna and I found that the ease we felt on the court translated off it as well. What started as a competitive partnership soon blossomed into something more. The way we supported each other during tough moments, the way we communicated and worked as a team, it all created a bond that was undeniable.

The connection between Shauna and I was no longer just about Pickleball \- it was about something deeper, something that had started to blossom in the background of our matches. The tournament didn’t just bring us a trophy; it brought us closer together in ways we hadn’t expected.

**From Partners on the Court to Partners in Life**

Sometimes, Pickleball isn’t just about the game. It’s about the people you meet, the friendships you form, and the unexpected connections that happen along the way. For Shauna and me, this tournament marked the beginning of something special. What started as a competitive partnership soon turned into something more \- something that felt right both on and off the court.

And that, for me, is the real victory.
